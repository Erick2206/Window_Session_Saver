# Window_Session_Saver
Session saving extension for Firefox. 

It is a work in progress. This extension will help users in closing Firefox Windows that are not required at a time and could be reloaded later.

This will help in saving the system resources (computing power, memory, etc) which could be used by other processes running on the system.
